# photo-album

This is my code for The Iron Yard's assignment, photo-album.

The purpose of this code is to practice manipulating and traversing the DOM using jQuery.

Clicking on a photo in the album will cause that selected photo to zoom in. Clicking on the left or right arrow will navigate through all photos in the album, un-zooming the current image, and zooming on the next or previous image depending on which arrow is clicked. 

To edit or add to this project, sass watch must be turned on to look for changes in CSS.
